    "A very useful application of text models (you can read more on them on the [`text notebook`](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/text.ipynb)) is categorizing text into a language. In fact, with enough data we can categorize correctly mostly any text. That is because different languages have certain characteristics that set them apart. For example, in German it is very usual for 'c' to be followed by 'h' while in English we see 't' followed by 'h' a lot.\n",
